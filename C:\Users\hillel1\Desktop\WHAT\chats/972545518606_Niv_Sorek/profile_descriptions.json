    "description": "The image shows an uppercase letter 'H' written in a surface of small, greyish pebbles or coarse sand. The letter is formed by an indentation or furrow pressed into the granular material. The edges of the 'H' are rough and uneven, made up of the displaced pebbles piled slightly around the furrow. The surface of the material is textured with the many small, uniformly sized particles. The letter is casting a distinct shadow towards the bottom right, indicating that the light source is coming from the top left. The perspective is a close-up view looking down at the surface. The overall impression is of a simple yet textural representation of the letter 'H' created on a natural, granular surface, possibly a beach or a pebbled path."
