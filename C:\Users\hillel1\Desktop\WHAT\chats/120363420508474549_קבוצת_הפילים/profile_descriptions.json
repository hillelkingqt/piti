    "description": "The image shows the letter 'H' written in coarse, greyish sand or fine gravel. The letter is formed by an indentation in the surface, creating raised edges around the carved area. The light source, likely from the left, casts distinct shadows to the right of the raised edges and within the indented parts of the letter. The texture of the surface is visible, composed of numerous small, uniform particles. The letter 'H' is roughly centered in the frame and appears to be written on a flat, horizontal surface viewed from above. The detail reveals the granular nature of the material and the texture of the ridges formed by the displacement of the sand."
