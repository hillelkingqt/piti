    "description": "This image is a logo displayed on a white background with black borders on all sides.\n\nOn the left side of the white area is a geometric logo. It appears to be formed from overlapping hexagonal or polygonal shapes, creating a layered effect. The shape on the left uses a gradient of blues, transitioning from a darker blue on the left edge to a lighter, brighter blue towards the center. The shape on the right uses a gradient of teal and green. In the center of these shapes is a diamond-shaped negative space, showing the white background. The overall shape of the logo is roughly hexagonal and elongated horizontally.\n\nOn the right side of the white area is text, aligned to the left. There are three lines of text:\n1.  The top line reads \"**Stud-Net**\" in large, bold, dark blue sans-serif font.\n2.  The middle line reads \"The Open University\" in smaller, dark grey or black sans-serif font.\n3.  The bottom line reads \"STUDENTS Community\" in the same size and color font as the middle line, with the word \"STUDENTS\" in all capital letters.\n\nThe logo and text are positioned centrally within the white area, which is framed by thick black bars on the top, bottom, left, and right."
