    "description": "This is a close-up, high-angle photograph of the capital letter \"H\" drawn into a surface of coarse, gray sand or fine gravel.\n\nThe letter is formed by indented lines or furrows, as if traced by a finger or a stick. The displaced sand is piled up along the edges of the lines, creating rough, crumbly ridges.\n\nStrong lighting, coming from the upper left, casts distinct dark shadows. These shadows fall to the right and bottom of the raised ridges and inside the furrows, giving the letter a strong sense of depth and three-dimensionality. The overall texture of the image is granular and tactile, with the individual pebbles and grains of sand clearly visible."
