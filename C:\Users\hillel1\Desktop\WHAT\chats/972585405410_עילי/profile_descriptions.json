    "description": "The image is a close-up, overhead view of the letter 'H' carved or written into a surface of sand. The sand appears to be composed of small, gray, granular particles, creating a textured background. The letter 'H' is formed by lines dug into the sand, creating recessed areas. The edges of these carved lines are rough and uneven, with small piles and ridges of displaced sand accumulated alongside them. Shadows are visible within the carved areas, particularly along the left side of the vertical strokes and underneath the horizontal bar, suggesting that the light source is coming from the top right of the frame. The contrast between the shadowed depressions and the raised, sunlit sand makes the letter stand out clearly against the granular background. The overall color palette is dominated by shades of gray and brown tones of the sand."
