 Meh-heh-heh. Welcome to the\n[kind:] Swap Shop. Want to swap? It'll\ncost ya [CS:G][gold_left:0][CR][M:S0].
 Meh-heh-heh. Anything else you\nwanna swap?
" Meh-heh-heh...[K] Hey, hold it!\nNo money, no swap. Got that?"
 Didn't I tell ya? It's [CS:G][gold_left:0][CR][M:S0]\nfor every swap. Meh-heh-heh![C]\n That means you don't have the\nmoney to do it right now!
" Let me take a look... Nope, you\ndon't have a set of swappable items. Meh-heh."
 Meh-heh-heh. Sorry...[C]\n It looks like there's nobody to trade with now.
 So which Exclusive Item do you\nwant?
 You don't wanna? Meh-heh-heh!
 What...? [K]Whoa![C]
 So you wanna swap your\n[item:1] and [item:2] for that?[C]\n It'll cost [CS:G][gold_left:0][CR][M:S0]. OK?
" So you wanna swap your\n[item:1], [item:2], and\n[item:3] for that?[C]\n It'll cost [CS:G][gold_left:0][CR][M:S0]. OK?"
" So you wanna swap your\n[digits:1] Exclusive Items, then?[C]\n It'll cost [CS:G][gold_left:0][CR][M:S0]. OK?"
 Let's do this swap then!\nMeh-heh-heh![C]
[CN][name:0] put the [se_play:0]Exclusive Items\n[CN]in the Swap Cauldron.[C]
 Meh-heh-heh![K]\nSeems to me your swap went off\nwithout a hitch![C]\n Those Exclusive Items you\nswapped got you this [item:1].[C]\n I'd say it's pretty rare.\nTreat it with care.\nMeh-heh-heh!!
[CN][hero] accepted\n[CN]the [me_play:1][item:1].
 Meh-heh-heh![K] Seems that we\nbrewed up a successful swap there![C]\n What? [K]What's that?!\n[item:1]?! I must be hallucinating![C]\n That's unbelievably valuable![K]\nSo incredibly special![C]\n I rarely see something so\nvaluable! Treat it with respect! Meh-heh-heh!
[CN][hero] accepted the extremely\n[CN]rare and precious [me_play:1][item:1]!
 ...But you can't take it. Not when\nyou don't have room for it! Meh-heh-heh.[C]\n So I'll send it to your storage\nlater. You be sure to check on it.
 See the Swap Cauldron behind\nme? When ya throw in some Exclusive Items...[C]\n They're swapped for one\nExclusive Item offered up by another Pokémon.[C]\n But you have to put in a set of\nswappable items![C]\n Don't worry. It's worth it. You\ncan get back rare items in swaps.[C]\n Count on it! Meh-heh-heh!
" If you look up the [CS:E]Info[CS::D] on\nitems, the ones that are Exclusive Items will \nhave this [M:S3] mark on them.[C]\n You'll need a set of items with\nthe [M:S3] mark to do the swap.[C]\n Let me give you an example.[K]\nLet's say you have a [CS:Z]Shinx Claw[CR] and\na [CS:Z]Shinx Fang[CR]...[C]\n You could swap them for\na [CS:Z]Flash Tag[CR]. Get it?[C]\n Also,[K] you don't have to be\nlimited to just your Treasure Bag...[C]\n You can trade the Exclusive\nItems in your storage as well.[C]\n So you don't have to worry\nabout dragging things out of your storage\nand lugging them all the way here.[C]\n Keep at your exploration thing\nso you can do better swaps, OK?\nMeh-heh-heh!"
 Which Exclusive Items will have\nan effect on you or your team...?[K]\nYou can view them in a list.[C]\n If you see an Exclusive Item you\nwant on the list...[K]then of course you can\ntrade for it!
 Come again! Meh-heh-heh!

 Huh? [K]You don't seem to have\nforgotten any moves...so I can't help you\nremember any!
 So which forgotten move do you\nwant to remember?

 Sure thing! What do you want to\nknow?
" When you use moves in a\ndungeon...[K]it takes time to use the move\nmenu each and every time![C]\n But you can take a shortcut by\nusing the Set option for instant use![C]\n After you set a move, you can\npress [M:B6] and [M:B2] to use it instantly![K]\nYou see? It's easy![C]\n Just set the move while in a\ndungeon...[K]then press [M:B6] and [M:B2] to use it![K]\nIt's so convenient![C]\n You can also switch your set\nmove at any time in a dungeon. Check it out!"
" When two or three moves are\nlinked...[K]you can unleash them as part of a\nsingle, chained move! All in one turn![C]\n For example, if the moves\n[CS:M]Scratch[CR] and [CS:M]Growl[CR] are linked...[C]\n Both [CS:M]Scratch[CR] and [CS:M]Growl[CR] are\nused in one turn![K] Amazing, huh?[C]\n If you use links...[K]well, depending\non which moves you link...[K]you can unleash\nsome powerful chained results![C]\n There is a slight drawback. Your\nBelly goes down faster if you use linked\nmoves...[C]\n And the more moves you have\nlinked together, the faster you'll get hungry![C]\n Here's a major detail. [K]Linked\nmoves are delivered from top to bottom!"
 You can split up linked moves by\nselecting the Delink command.[C]\n You can also switch around the\norder in which linked moves are delivered.[C]\n Switch them by pressing [M:B7]\nwhile pressing up or down on [M:B8].[C]\n Think about how you can combine\nmoves to create powerful chain effects!

" What if you had to forget a\nmove, then later wanted it back?[K]\nIt happens a lot, right?[C]\n That's when you need to come\nsee me for my help.[C]\n My shocking talents can jolt you\ninto remembering forgotten moves![C]\n You know, things slip our minds,\nand we forget important stuff.[C]\n All it takes is a tiny jolt![K]\nJust a bracing zap!

"All Pokémon can hold one item at a time. Some\nitems, when held, raise stats or prevent status\nproblems (such as a [CS:I]Bow[CR]). When a Berry is\nheld, however, it will be eaten by the Pokémon\nwhen needed (such as an [CS:I]Oran Berry[CR]).\n\nAll held items are [CS:C]put back in the Bag[CR] when the\nteam member goes on standby, so be sure to\ngive new team members a held item!"
"There are two kinds of attack [CS:E]moves[CR]: physical\nattacks and special attacks. Physical attacks\nare based on the stats [CS:E]Attack[CR] and [CS:E]Defense[CR].\nSpecial attacks are based on the stats [CS:E]Special[CR]\n[CS:E]Attack[CR] and [CS:E]Special Defense[CR].\n\nAll [CS:E]moves[CR] affect targets in a specific range.\nExamples: in front of the user, in the line of\nsight, and all targets in the room. Check the\ndescription of each [CS:E]move[CR] for these details!"
"You can link [CS:E]moves[CR] at the [CS:K]Electivire[CR] Link Shop\nor with a [CS:I]Link Box[CR]. [CS:E]Linked moves[CR] are used, one\nafter the other, as a chained combo delivered\nin a single turn. Using a [CS:E]linked move[CR] to defeat\nan enemy will earn you bonus Exp. Points.\n\nThough using [CS:E]linked moves[CR] makes the team's\n[CS:E]Belly[CR] empty faster, it's worth the trouble,\nespecially when trying to beat tough enemies!"
"The [CS:E]Attack[CR] and [CS:E]Defense[CR] stats of your team\nmembers may become temporarily reduced by\nenemies' [CS:E]moves[CR] and other dungeon effects!\n\nIf that happens, search for a floor tile with an\narrow, then step on it to get rid of the stat\nreduction. Caution: this tile will remove stat\nboosts as well!"
"You may find [CS:K]Kecleon[CR] selling its wares on a\nred rug in dungeons. If you want to buy a\npriced item, pick it up, then speak to [CS:K]Kecleon[CR].\nIf you want to sell something, put it on the\nrug, then speak to [CS:K]Kecleon[CR].\n\nIf you walk off the rug while holding\nmerchandise or if you use the item while on\nthe rug, you'll have to pay for it. Caution:\nyou'll be labeled a [CS:C]thief[CR] if you can't pay!"
"Let's say that you (the player) want to take a\nbreak while inside a dungeon. You can! Select\nthe [CS:E]Rest[CR] option, then [CS:E]Quicksave[CR]. You can then\nturn off the game and resume play later.\n\nCaution: If you resume play using [CS:E]Quicksave[CR],\nthen want to later turn off the power, you\nmust then save again! If you don't, you'll lose\nall progress (including money, items, and Exp.\nPoints) since your last save at a save point."

"Any job you accept from the Job Bulletin Board\nor Outlaw Notice Board will appear on your Job\nList. To activate a job mission, you must then\nselect its [CS:E]Take Job[CR] option.

Fortunately,\nyou may be able to recruit more Pokémon to\nthe team by defeating enemies in dungeons and\ncompleting jobs. All Pokémon have a variety of\n[CS:E]moves[CR] and [CS:E]abilities[CR], so get to know what each\noffers to the team by checking out Summary in\nthe Team section of the menu."
"Before you go to a dungeon, stop by [CS:K]Chimecho[CR]\nAssembly and assemble the perfect team for\nthe mission ahead. You can put up to four\nmembers in the team. The team must also be\nno larger than the team's combined body size\nof 6 [M:S3] marks.\n\nNote: Some dungeons have stricter limits on\nthe number of team members and total team\nbody size."
"You will find Gummi treats in dungeons. No\nPokémon can resist these colorful treats!\n\nThey raise a Pokémon's [CS:E]IQ[CR], which\nhelps them develop many smart new skills that\nare important for exploration. Gummis come in\ncolors that are tied to Pokémon types, so give\na team member a matching Gummi to raise its\n[CS:E]IQ[CR] the most. Eating a Gummi in a dungeon might\nalso affect stats other than [CS:E]IQ[CR]!"
