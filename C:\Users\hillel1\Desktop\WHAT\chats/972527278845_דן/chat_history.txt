The first page covers:
*   **General Definitions:** Definitions of ODE, order, degree, linear vs. non-linear, types of solutions (general, particular, singular), and the Existence and Uniqueness Theorem (Picard).
*   **First Order ODEs:** Formulas and methods for solving Separable, Homogeneous, "Almost Homogeneous", Exact, and Linear First Order ODEs. This includes methods like integrating factors and substitutions. It also covers the Bernoulli equation.
*   **Second Order ODEs:** Methods for solving Second Order ODEs, including order reduction for specific cases (missing y or missing x). It details linear homogeneous ODEs with constant coefficients, including the characteristic equation and solutions based on root types (real distinct, real repeated, complex). It also covers linear non-homogeneous ODEs with constant coefficients, explaining the general solution structure (homogeneous + particular) and the Method of Undetermined Coefficients, including a table for building the guess set S and handling resonance.

The second page covers:
*   **Additional Techniques:**
    *   Using the inverse relationship x(y) instead of y(x).
    *   Clairaut's equation (general and singular solutions).
    *   Linear ODEs with non-constant coefficients, including finding a second homogeneous solution using Reduction of Order and solving non-homogeneous equations using Variation of Parameters (formulas involving the Wronskian).
    *   Solving ODEs using Power Series (Taylor series around x0=0), outlining the steps for finding a recurrence relation and the solution.
    *   A list of common Taylor series expansions around 0.
*   **Common Integrals:** A table of frequently used integral formulas.
*   **Trigonometric Identities:** A list of common trigonometric identities (sum/difference, double angle, Pythagorean, etc.).
*   **Integration Methods:** Brief descriptions of Integration by Parts and Substitution (change of variable).
*   **Partial Fraction Decomposition:** Steps for integrating rational functions by decomposing them into partial fractions based on the denominator's factors.
*   **Euler-Cauchy Equation:** Form of the equation and the method of solution by assuming y=x^m, leading to an indicial equation, and the solutions based on the roots (real distinct, real repeated, complex conjugate), using |x| for the domain.

The document serves as a concise reference for various methods and formulas used in solving ODEs.
