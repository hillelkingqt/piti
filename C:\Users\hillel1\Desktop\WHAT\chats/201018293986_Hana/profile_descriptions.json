    "description": "A close-up, top-down view shows the capital letter \"H\" incised into a surface of fine, greyish-brown sand. The letter is formed by a trench dug into the sand, creating two vertical strokes connected by a horizontal stroke in the middle. The edges of the letter are rough and irregular, with small mounds and clumps of sand displaced from the incision, giving a textured, slightly raised appearance around the perimeter of the carved lines. Prominent shadows are cast to the right of the raised edges, indicating a light source coming from the left. These shadows accentuate the depth of the trenches and the texture of the displaced sand and the surrounding surface. The sand background is uniformly granular, showing individual grains. The overall impression is one of a tactile carving in a sandy medium, highlighted by strong directional lighting."
