    "description": "The image shows a close-up, overhead view of the uppercase letter \"H\" inscribed in a surface made of small, uniform, gray-colored granules or pebbles. The letter is formed by a distinct groove dug into the material. Along the edges of the groove, the material is pushed up, creating uneven, raised ridges and small mounds, which cast clear shadows to the right, indicating the light source is coming from the upper left. The texture of the surface is rough and granular, with each small particle visible. The inside of the inscribed letter appears slightly darker than the surrounding raised material and the flat surface. The letter \"H\" is centrally positioned and takes up a significant portion of the frame, with the surrounding textured surface filling the rest of the image. The overall impression is one of a simple, textured mark made in a loose, rocky or sandy medium under bright, directional sunlight."
